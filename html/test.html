    <p>In Unix-like operating systems, a shebang is the character sequence #! (a hash symbol followed by an exclamation mark) at the beginning of a script.<br> It's used to specify the interpreter that should execute the script. It's also <b>known</b> as a <strong>hashbang</strong>, sharp-exclamation, pound-bang, or hash-pling.</p>

    <p>Benefits:
Convenience:
Makes scripts executable without specifying the interpreter on the command line.
Portability:
<em>Using #!/usr/bin/env python can make the script more portable as it finds the python executable in the user's environment, rather than relying on a specific path.
Limitations:</em>

Operating <em>System</em>   <i>System</i> Dependent: Shebangs are primarily used in Unix-like systems and are ignored by Windows unless using compatibility layers like WSL.
Interpreter Path: If the interpreter path changes, the shebang line may need to be updated.

  H<sub>2</sub>O        <!-- Defines subscript text  H2O -->

  <p>H<sub>2</sub>O is the chemical formula for water. It signifies that a water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Water, in its liquid state, is a transparent, tasteless, and odorless substance, essential for life on Earth. It is also the main component of the Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids within living organisms. </p>

mc<sup>2</sup>     <!-- Defines Superscript text  E=mc2 -->

<hr>


<p>E=mc<sup>2</sup>, also known as the mass-energy equivalence, is a famous equation developed by Albert Einstein. It states that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable and related by the speed of light squared (c²). This means that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Epsilon naught (ε₀), also known as the permittivity of free space,

  to permit electric field lines. Its value is approximately <mark>8.854 x 10⁻¹² F/m</mark>(Farads per meter). This value is crucial in many areas of physics, particularly in electromagnetism. </p>
